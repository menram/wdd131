                    My name is Ricardo and I was born in Mexico, but live in Nevada. I enjoy visiting new places as
                    well as spending time with friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like visiting pueblos magicos, and love the colonial and pre-hispanic architecture. The
                    construction is amazing and it was made to last. I can only imagine how much effort it would take to
                    build some of these great structures, but it is exactly what makes visiting these places a must.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I don't enjoy going to these places alone. One of the greatest things is to be able to
                    share these moments and experiences with the people you love.
                    I can't wait to go somewhere amazing and get to share it with my family.

                <p>
                    Nevada is a beautiful place that has a lot more than casinos and big hotels. It has desert
                    landscapes in the south, including red rocks, mountains throughout, and lots of pines up north.
                    Having said that, Las Vegas is such a sight to see. At night it is a spectacular show of lights, and
                    during the day the architecture of the tourist areas can be truly appreciated with the light of day.
                </p>

                    Did you know that Nevada generates near 75% of all the gold in the USA?
